# Analysis-of-Different-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Stock-Price-Prediction

## Introduction
For this project, we implemented two models for predicting future stock price values for a certain company. Our research is based on stock prices of different companies. We obtained stock prices from CAC40 Stocks Dataset[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/cac40-stocks-dataset] to give data for each model. 

## Dependencies:
1. Edit the PATH variable in Stock_Prediciton.py to where the dataset is stored.

2. Python 3, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, datetime
Install the required packages, run pip install streamlit==1.9.0; pip install statsmodels; pip install plotly==5.7.0

## Issues for MAC:
The TensorFlow support is not there for M1 and M1 pro yet and thats why we noticed we were not able to run the code in Mac.
